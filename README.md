# TextChanger
An elementary console-based project written in C# Language which is kind of basic text modifier app.
This can: i) Tell the total number of words in a txt file. It is useful to know the word count of a passage, paragraph or any txt file.
          ii) It can change specific word provided by a user into another word which is useful when someone finds it hard to change all the same word individually.
I have done this to enhance my concept and knowledge on data structure and on OOP.
