# TextChanger
An elementary console-based project written in C# Language which can change all the specific words specified by the user.
Yes! it's true that there are already some methods in C# which can perform the similar task. But this console app can perform in a specified text file and has some useful method overloads. And I have done this to enhance my concept and knowledge on data structure and on OOP.
